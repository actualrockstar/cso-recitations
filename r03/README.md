Recitation 03
=============

In today's recitation exercises, we are going to practice conversion between
binary representation and decimal values, and bit operations.

Binary representation
----------------------
In e1.c, you will be asked to do conversion between binary representations and
decimal values for integer and float. All questions are written in code
comments. Please read through the file and change the variable values
correspondingly to provide your answers.

Bit operations
--------------
In e2.c, you will be asked to implement two simple functions using bit
operations. The instructions are in comments of e2.c

How to run your code
--------------------
We provide you with a simple Makefile. By typing `make` in the command line,
your answers will be compiled. Then you can run with `./e1` and `./e2`
respectively.

We grade your exercises by judging the output of the program and the output must be an exact match of instructor's answer. So don't add or
change anything that will affect printing. Also, remember you need to
always test your code in our lab VM.

What to submit and how?
------------------------
Before submitting your solution, you should type **git diff** to see what you
change. Be sure that you only change what you are allowed to change.

Then submit modified files by:

**git add e1.c e2.c**  
**git commit -m "r03"**  
**git push**
