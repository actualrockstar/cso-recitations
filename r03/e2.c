// Implement the following two functions using bit operations

// Q1: Toggle the n-th bit of an int
// Given an int variable a, flip the n-th bit of it
// Note, n is 0-indexed and starts from the right. In other words, 0-th bit is
// the least significant bit and 31-th bit is the most significant bit.
// For example, if a = 10 and n = 0, the function should return 11
//              if a = 10 and n = 1, the function should return 8
// You may assume 0 <= n <= 31
int toggle_nth_bit(int a, int n) {
  //Your code here

  return 0;
}

// Q2: Count number of bits that are equal to 1 in a binary representation of
// an unsigned int a
// For example, if a = 5, then binary representation of a is 101. So the
// function should return 2
int count_ones(unsigned int a) {
  int count = 0;
  // Your code here

  return count;
}
